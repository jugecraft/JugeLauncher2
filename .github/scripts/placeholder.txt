  // However, for standalone reliability in the workflow, we'll write it to be used inside the 'script' block of github-script action directly
  // OR we can write a standalone node script if we install @octokit/rest. 
  // To keep it simple in the workflow, we will put the logic inside the yaml or a simplified js file that reads env vars.
  
  // Actually, let's keep it simple: 
  // We will INLINE the script in the YAML to have access to the pre-authenticated 'github' client from 'actions/github-script'.
  // Writing a file here is complex if we can't easily resolve dependencies.
